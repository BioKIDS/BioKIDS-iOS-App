<b>About BioKIDS:</b><br>
It is increasingly important for all American students to become
sophisticated thinkers of science. The BioKIDS/DeepThink research
group is engaged in educational research to improve science learning
in high-poverty, urban, elementary and middle school classrooms,
with particular focus on the Detroit Public Schools. Our work centers
on the fourth through eighth grades, a period when the performance
of American students in science falls behind that of students in
other countries. We work in two areas:
<ul>
<li>the development of curricular units and associated technologies to
promote students' deep understandings of current science topics, and</li>
<li>the exploration of new ideas in educational assessment leading to
tests that evaluate students' complex reasoning with science.</li>
</ul>
