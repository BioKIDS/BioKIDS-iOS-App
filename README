The BioKIDS iOS app is a universal app that allows elementary and
middle school students to collect data about plants and animals
found in their schoolyard or another location.  The collected data
(observations) may be saved to the BioKIDS server.

Recorded observations are stored in Core Data and uploaded to the server
in CSV format using NSURLConnection (HTTP POST).

The data collection sequence (series of screens) is controlled by the
contents of the BioKIDS/en.lproj/sequence.plist file.

Most recently, the app was built using Xcode 4.0.2 and iOS SDK 4.3.
